            <h4>Text-to-Speech Feature:</h4> Our text-to-speech feature enables students to listen to text, aiding
            comprehension and pronunciation. This tool helps students grasp concepts more effectively and develop their
            language skills.
            <h4>Speech-to-Text Feature:</h4> With our speech-to-text feature, students can practice forming sentences
            and understanding sentence structure. This feature promotes language production and reinforces grammar and
            syntax rules.
            <h4>Quiz Page:</h4> Our quiz page offers thought-provoking questions to stimulate critical thinking and
            problem-solving skills. Engaging with these quizzes encourages active learning and enhances cognitive
            abilities.
            <h4>Listen and Answer Feature: </h4>Our listen and answer feature challenges students to improve their
            listening skills by listening to audio prompts and responding in writing. This exercise strengthens auditory
            processing and reinforces comprehension skills.
